          <p style="margin-top:45px">COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a <strong>cold, the flu, or pneumonia</strong>. COVID-19 may attack more than your lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be affected by the disease. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill.</p>
          <p>Some people including those with minor or no symptoms will develop Post-COVID Conditions – also called “Long COVID.”</p>
